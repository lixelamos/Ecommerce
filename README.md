# E-shop
This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), a fast build tool for modern web development.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn dev`

Runs the app in development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `yarn serve`

After running the build script, you can use this script to serve your production build locally.
It starts a static server to serve your optimized production files.
This allows you to test your production build locally before deploying it to a live server.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html#testing) for more information.

### `yarn lint`

Runs a linter on your codebase to check for and report any syntax or style errors.
It helps maintain consistent code style and catch potential bugs early in the development process.

## Deployment

This project is ready to be deployed to your preferred hosting platform.
Make sure to run `yarn build` to create a production-ready build before deploying.

## Acknowledgements
